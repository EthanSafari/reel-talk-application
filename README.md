At this current time, only the "favorite genre selection" part of the application onboarding challenge is available to view. Future plans have been made to incorporate the "favorite shows and movies"
part of the application onboarding utilizing an external API [TMBD: The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) in order for the user to dynamically retrieve and view whatever information they would like about shows they're interested and may be interested in without limits.

With limited knowledge of Typescript, TailwindCSS and NextJS, and how they all come together in order to build a streamlined frontend, I appreciate the opportunity that everyone over at REEL TALK was able to provide me, as I have never dove into this combination of skills before. I am thankful to be given the opportunity to bridge my gap in knowledge from JavaScript to the more stable TypeScript and CSS3 to the streamlined TailwindCSS, as well as develop more knowledge than I previously had with NextJS. I plan on continuing with this challenge until I finish the "favorite shows and movies", and may continue working on it even after. As I do, this repo will be updated accordingly. Again, thank you to all the people at Reel Talk, and I hope they enjoy what they see.
